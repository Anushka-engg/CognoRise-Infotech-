Data Analytics Internship At CognoRise Info Tech 

Task 1:
Project: Analysis of 80 Cereals uses the dataset of  “80 Cereals”, which is a dataset composed of 79 entries with 16 measured variables. With the help of jupyter note, Pandas, tableau, Microsoft Excel and Power BI I analysed this dataset deeply.

description features-
1. Most popular types of cereals and brands?
Are there any relationships between sugars, calories, fat and carbo?
Is there a relationship between protein, sodium, fiber, potass, vitamins, and shelf?
What are the most influential factors or features that contribute to the ratings of cereals ?

This dataset provides detailed nutritional and categorical information about various cereal products, including:

1. Name: The name of the cereal.

2. Calories: The number of calories per serving.

3. Protein: Grams of protein per serving.

4. Fat: Grams of fat per serving.

5. Sodium: Milligrams of sodium per serving.

6. Fiber: Grams of dietary fiber per serving.

7. Carbo: Grams of complex carbohydrates per serving.

8. Sugars: Grams of sugar per serving.

9. Potass: Milligrams of potassium per serving.

10. Vitamins: The percentage of the FDA's recommended daily value of vitamins and minerals.
  

11. Shelf: The display shelf where the cereal is placed in stores.

12. Weight: The weight in ounces of one serving.

13. Cups: The number of cups in one serving.

14. Rating: A rating of the cereals, possibly sourced from Consumer Reports.

Acknowledgements: This dataset was collected and cleaned by Petra Isenberg, Pierre Dragicevic, and Yvonne Jansen. The original source is available online.
Inspiration: The dataset can be used to analyze the nutritional content of cereals, particularly focusing on sugar content and how it might impact appetite.


Task 2:

Project: Analyse Employee salary according to their job title, company ratio and remote ratio. In the Dataset we give Salary and Salary in Us dollar, I analysed employee salary on the basis their experience level and their salary.
This dataset captures detailed information about job roles and salaries, including:

1. Work Year: The year when the salary was paid.
2. Experience Leve: The employee's experience level during the year, categorized as:
   - EN: Entry-level / Junior
   - MI: Mid-level / Intermediate
   - SE: Senior-level / Expert
   - EX: Executive-level / Director

3. Employment Type: The type of employment, including:
   - PT: Part-time
   - FT: Full-time
   - CT: Contract
   - FL: Freelance

4. Job Title: The role held by the employee during the year.

5. Salary: The total gross salary amount paid.

6. Salary Currency: The currency in which the salary was paid, using ISO 4217 currency codes.

7. Salary in USD: The salary converted to USD, based on the average exchange rate for the respective year.

8. Employee Residence: The primary country of residence of the employee during the work year, denoted by ISO 3166 country codes.

9. Remote Ratio: The extent of remote work involved, categorized as:
   - 0: No remote work (less than 20%)
   - 50: Partially remote
   - 100:Fully remote (more than 80%)

10. Company Location: The country of the employer’s main office or contracting branch, using ISO 3166 country codes.

11. Company Size: The average number of employees at the company during the year, categorized as:
    - S: Small (less than 50 employees)
    - M: Medium (50 to 250 employees)
    - L: Large (more than 250 employees)




Task 3:
Project: Wine Quality Prediction-

This dataset contains physicochemical properties of wine and their corresponding quality scores, making it suitable for both regression and classification tasks. The dataset includes the following variables:

Input Variables (Physicochemical Tests):
1. Fixed Acidity: The level of non-volatile acids in the wine.

2. Volatile Acidity: The amount of acetic acid in the wine, which can affect the taste.

3. Citric Acid: A small amount of citric acid that can add freshness to the wine.

4. Residual Sugar: The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation.

5. Chlorides: The amount of salt in the wine.

6. Free Sulfur Dioxide: The free form of SO2, which prevents microbial growth and oxidation.

7. Total Sulfur Dioxide: The total amount of SO2, both free and bound.

8. Density: The density of the wine, which can influence mouthfeel and quality.

9. pH: The acidity or basicity of the wine.

10. Sulphates: A wine preservative that can also contribute to the taste.

11. Alcohol: The alcohol content of the wine.

12. Quality: A score between 0 and 10, representing the wine's quality based on sensory evaluation.

Inspiration:
This dataset is ideal for practicing machine learning techniques to identify which physicochemical properties contribute to a wine being classified as "good."
